## Restaurant Reviews App

   Project 5 for **Google - Udacity FEND Nanodegree Scholarship** Program.

### Project Overview

   * For this **Restaurant Reviews App** project, Convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

   * Take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use.

   * Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

### How to run this Application?

   * Clone or download this repository to your local computer. If downloaded, unzip the folder.

   * From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal.

   * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. 
   
   * If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   
   * With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like in responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

   * This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### About ES6

   * Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript while coding.
